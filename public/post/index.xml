  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;routine&#34;&gt;Routine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a quiet but eventful week. We celebrated my friend Vicki&amp;rsquo;s birthday, met interesting people, had a lot of things: a pajama party, a murder investigation game, a PowerPoint party, lots of delicious food and everything. At the same time, I met a friend who came from another city for her birthday and managed to give her a mini-tour of the campus. My mom also came to visit me for the weekend, and we had a great time together. We played billiards, walked, and had a delicious meal. After a long break for the holidays, I finally met my beloved classmates, we already missed each other very much. I met my brother, and this weekend I&amp;rsquo;m going to his soccer tournament, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to cheer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;study&#34;&gt;Study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time, I expressed my anger about the programming technology class. I would like to inform you that by today&amp;rsquo;s class I had completed all four laboratory work, and last Wednesday I defended the second one. There are two remaining defenses (read Pavlovskaya!!) And that&amp;rsquo;s basically it. In general, as the semester approaches the end, many subjects are already closing and the exams and the session are approaching(( But never mind, we will cope!! Now we need to focus on matlogics and matanalysis, the tests are coming up, and over the holidays we forgot everything and now we need to catch up and do our homework. In addition, I am urgently completing tests on subjects, completing an individual project, laboratory work and an external course on operating systems. In general, things are going through the roof, as always!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;weather&#34;&gt;Weather&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s nice that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t +30 heat and it&amp;rsquo;s possible to be outside, but on the other hand, I wish it was a little warmer by at least a few degrees. It was mostly this week +8 - +10 And it&amp;rsquo;s raining all the time. But I like rain, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like cold:( I don&amp;rsquo;t want to wear a jacket in May anymore, let&amp;rsquo;s have good weather!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all one to one: rainy weather - and most of all I want to listen to the band alt-J. I just overlistened to them, their music is literally saturated with freshness, rain, and tranquility. I also listened to Champs, Labrinth, Fleetwood Mac, Jacob Bellens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;assessment-of-the-week&#34;&gt;Assessment of the week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9/10. The weather spoils everything a bit, but everything else was fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details class=&#34;print:hidden xl:hidden&#34; open&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;text-sm&#34;&gt;
  &lt;nav id=&#34;TableOfContents&#34;&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#thus-each-of-the-listed-languages-is-specialized-to-solve-a-certain-type-of-problem-the-choice-of-the-appropriate-language-depends-on-the-goals-and-objectives-of-the-programmer&#34;&gt;Thus, each of the listed languages ​​is specialized to solve a certain type of problem. The choice of the appropriate language depends on the goals and objectives of the programmer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of programming languages ​​in the world today - how to choose the best one to learn? We publish a list of the most popular options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bash&lt;/strong&gt;. Unix shell scripting, created by Ken Thompson in the early 1970s, is closely related to the C programming language. Bash, an updated Unix shell, was first released in the late 80s and is still actively developed. Bash is commonly used for writing server configuration scripts, making it a good choice for working in modern cloud environments with container storage and microservices. Shell scripting is used quite often, so knowing this language will come in handy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C/C++&lt;/strong&gt;.
These languages ​​often occupy the top of various rankings - they are valued for their power and speed. C was created in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, C++ was developed in 1985 by Bjarne Stroustrup. Today, these two languages ​​underlie everything from operating systems and games to modern scientific computing and machine learning. C and C++ are well suited for demanding applications that require low-level access to hardware and performance. Learning these languages ​​takes time and some effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C#&lt;/strong&gt;, released by Microsoft in 2000, was developed by Anders Hejlsberg as a cross-platform object-oriented programming language. Nowadays, it is often used to develop business applications, APIs, games, and more. Its wide range of features makes it suitable for graphics and other asynchronous programming tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Java&lt;/strong&gt; is a general-purpose object-oriented programming language developed in the 1990s by James Gosling at Sun (now owned by Oracle) and designed to be compiled into bytecode to run on the Java Virtual Machine. By 2020, these include almost every kind of device, from TVs and game consoles to servers, phones, and even kitchen appliances. The language is widely used in corporations and universities, making it popular with both novice programmers and experienced developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt; was developed by Brandon Eich in the 1990s to add script execution to websites. Today, it is a universal web interface language with powerful, standardized features that are supported by all major browsers. JavaScript follows the EcmaScript standard, which is updated every few years with new language specifications. JavaScript is also commonly used to develop server-side services and APIs, mobile apps, games, and other software. It is a great choice for learning and improving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;. Introduced in 1991 by Guido van Rossum, Python was conceived as a readable language with OOP features that uses functional paradigms to build clean and well-organized programs. Python has support on major platforms and is used in a variety of fields, including science, data mining, artificial intelligence, computer graphics for feature films, cloud computing, game development, and many others. Python has proven itself and will remain one of the most in-demand tools for a long time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQL&lt;/strong&gt; is a general-purpose programming language, but is a powerful domain-specific language for managing relational databases. Its use cases range from Fortune 500 data warehouses to embedded SQLite, and it is widely used in desktop and mobile applications. Many IT and development positions require at least basic knowledge of SQL. Advanced skills allow a developer to create extremely secure and reliable domain rules independent of the programming language or SDK used. High-profile implementations include Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, and PostgreSQL. Each of them has a unique extension of the SQL language and offers new features that go beyond the basic SQL specification. Learning SQL does not take much time and is useful in many areas from analytics and data processing to IT management and software development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thus-each-of-the-listed-languages-is-specialized-to-solve-a-certain-type-of-problem-the-choice-of-the-appropriate-language-depends-on-the-goals-and-objectives-of-the-programmer&#34;&gt;Thus, each of the listed languages ​​is specialized to solve a certain type of problem.

&lt;/nav&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-sections-of-the-report&#34;&gt;Main sections of the report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When making a report, it is important to include the following mandatory sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;purpose-of-the-work&#34;&gt;Purpose of the work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brief description of why the work is being carried out. For example:
The purpose of the work is to familiarize yourself with the basic commands of the Linux shell and learn how to create scripts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;task&#34;&gt;Task&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A list or text indicating what needs to be done during the laboratory. This can be either a text description or a list:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;**Task:**

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;2. Create a script `backup.sh `.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;3. Set up a cron task.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;theoretical-introduction&#34;&gt;Theoretical introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An explanation of the key concepts and approaches needed to complete the work. Here you can use lists, highlights, headers, links:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A detailed description of the execution steps with explanations, code, command outputs and, if necessary, images.
You can insert screenshots as follows:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;![Результат выполнения скрипта](images/script_output.png)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To insert the code, use three apostrophes at the top indicating the language before the code and three apostrophes after the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Hello, world!&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;

For example:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the work, the basic shell commands were mastered and an automatic backup script was created. Now I understand how cron works and can automate simple tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;useful-markdown-elements&#34;&gt;Useful Markdown Elements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headlines: #, ##, ### — for the logical structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code: triple quotes or single backtracks (`) are used to insert the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists: -, * or 1. — for bulleted and numbered lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;[GitHub](https://github.com)

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#assessment-of-the-week&#34;&gt;Assessment of the week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;routine&#34;&gt;Routine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been an eventful week. A lot of new people came into my life, and on Monday night we congratulated Timofey on his birthday and wished him a Student of the Year award. And so it turned out: he won the audience award, which we happily celebrated. I also want to mention my favorite mint smoothie, which I take from a well-known institution. It was very tasty, I drank two servings that evening and went to rest. The weekend was fun and flew by with a bang. Believe me, it was fun. In general, we walked a lot during the week, we are also actively preparing for the second stage of the school of curators, there were a lot of meetings and filming, much more needs to be done in the next two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;study&#34;&gt;Study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying this week didn&amp;rsquo;t feel so obvious due to the abundance of other things to do. But I don&amp;rsquo;t even want to talk about yesterday: the programming technology class just shocked me! It is necessary to do five hundred laboratory works at the same time, while turning over a lot of theory for each one, write reports and defend them. And all this falls just at the time when I will be doing vital things and I will not be up to it!! Why are they all together at the same time???!! Still, the only thing that doesn&amp;rsquo;t bring nerves is the Spanish class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;weather&#34;&gt;Weather&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kaleidoscope again. It was just unbearable heat for a week, summer, +25, then sharply +5 and the wind - I had to get my jacket and coat back, and today, on the spring and labor day, it was raining all day. But I love it when you&amp;rsquo;re sitting at home, studying, watching movies or reading books, generally doing anything - you look out the window, and everything is green and it&amp;rsquo;s raining, such a pleasant fresh smell and soothing sound of rain. One hundred out of a hundred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to my favorite band INXS, I can say that it was a women&amp;rsquo;s week in terms of music: Adele, Sia, Sinead O&amp;rsquo;Connor, Amy Winehouse and others, as well as a large number of Bruno Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;assessment-of-the-week&#34;&gt;Assessment of the week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8/10. Probably due to the weather changes, the sluggish state, as well as everyone left for their cities((&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;routine&#34;&gt;Routine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekend is very busy. Last week, a friend from another city came to see me, we hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen each other for 5 months and we missed each other very much. We went for a walk, I introduced her to my friends, it was fun. When she left, everything went back to normal: studying, household chores. It was Sasha&amp;rsquo;s birthday, we were congratulating him at night and I dropped the cake. But everything went well in the end. This weekend I even managed to arrange a sleepover with my best friend, whom I rarely see because of our studies. But every our meeting is a kind of celebration!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;study&#34;&gt;Study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two tests on the same day during the week, which put me under a lot of stress. I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for the results, the preparation should have paid off. After them, I feel less busy, I rest more and go about my business, I even got to the festival of Swahili culture in the main building of the Rudn University. English classes are so diverse.. In general, I&amp;rsquo;m glad that during the classes, and between them, and even in time free from them, there are friends with whom it&amp;rsquo;s more fun to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;weather&#34;&gt;Weather&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;rsquo;t have the words for the weather. There was a good plus temperature during the week, and on Friday it was summer in general! The sun, the heat was +15, it was such a good mood! And what do I see the next day?! The heat abruptly left, the wind, the rain, it actually snowed on Sunday and it will be like this all week!! Of course, I understand that it&amp;rsquo;s a sin for me, a northern person, to complain about the winter in April, but that&amp;rsquo;s not why I moved. In general, there is no positive feedback about the weather, let it be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plunged into some memories of bygone years, turning on my playlist from the end. And there it was: Russian rap, and the legendary foreign hip-hop of the noughties, and the 80s with Bowie and Queen, and the eternally cheerful Spain, which sounded in every house where the radio worked on sunny weekends. It&amp;rsquo;s just nostalgia, which seems to be returning to fashion in the world of my preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;assessment-of-the-week&#34;&gt;Assessment of the week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ill-give-910-again-the-tests-and-the-weather-are-to-blame&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll give 9/10 again. The tests and the weather are to blame!!&lt;/h2&gt;

For it to be 10/10, everything must be perfect, and who doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a single breakdown in a whole week!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;routine&#34;&gt;Routine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a lot of useful things over the weekend. I did a general cleaning in the room, read books, did laboratory work. I try to adjust my sleep schedule and eat right. I start every morning with exercises, stretching, and music. It helps a lot to wake up, warm up the body, raises the mood and the desire to start a new day. The event of the week happened today: Dad came to Moscow, we saw each other for a few hours, I&amp;rsquo;m very glad)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;homework&#34;&gt;Homework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much homework during the week, but it accumulated closer to the weekend. I am currently doing a project and laboratory work on operating systems. Of the rest, I need to make a history report by Saturday, write code on programming technology. I&amp;rsquo;m not happy with my homework, I want to go for a walk:(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;weather&#34;&gt;Weather&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather turned out to be strange and changeable this week. The snow and -6, the sun and +7, as, for example, today. I would rather have a full-fledged spring, bask in the sun and enjoy life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I&amp;rsquo;m listening to super calm, light spring songs, mostly French for some reason. Also, Elvis Presley and other talented performers of that era have often been heard in my playlist in recent days. I can&amp;rsquo;t help but mention the opera: the roles of Luciano Pavarotti from such opera classics as Giuseppe Verdi&amp;rsquo;s Rigoletto, Georges Bizet&amp;rsquo;s Carmen, and Aram Khachaturian&amp;rsquo;s Masquerade. This is very talented and takes you by the heart, brings you some kind of peace.&lt;/p&gt;

It is used to write readme files and documentation, and its operating principles are used to format messages and publications in instant messengers and social networks.
Markdown is easily converted to HTML, opens in all text editors and is easy to read even in the form of source code. At the same time, it is much easier to write in it than in other markup languages: HTML, XML, TeX, and so on.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;markup-language&#34;&gt;Markup language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the IT sphere, a markup language is a certain set of symbols and their sequences, embedded in the text in order to convey information about the structure of this document and its final form. As a result, the text document looks like a text with all punctuation marks, supplemented by code with information about the structure of this text.
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that converts text into structured HTML. It can be opened and edited in any text editor. It is widely used for writing documentation and README files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-markdown-commands&#34;&gt;Basic Markdown Commands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a heading, use the ( # ) sign.
To make text bold, enclose it in double asterisks.
To make text italic, enclose it in single asterisks.
To make text bold and italic, enclose it in triple asterisks.
Blockquotes are created using the &amp;gt; symbol.
An unordered (bulleted) list can be formatted using asterisks or dashes.
To nest one list within another, indent the child list items.
An ordered list can be formatted using the appropriate numbers.
To nest one list within another, indent the child list items.
The Markdown syntax for an inline link consists of a [link text] part, which is the hyperlink text, and a (file-name.md) part, which is the URL or file name of the file being linked to.
Markdown supports both embedding code fragments in a sentence and placing them between sentences as separate fenced blocks. Fenced code blocks are an easy way to highlight the syntax for code fragments.
Inline formulas are made similar to LaTeX formulas.
We will use Pandoc to process files in Markdown format. Specifically, we will need the pandoc program,
pandoc-citeproc &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases&lt;/a&gt;, pandoc-crossref
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref/releases&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref/releases&lt;/a&gt;.
You can transform the README.md file as follows:
1 pandoc README.md -o README.pdf
or like this
1 pandoc README.md -o README.docx
You can use the following Makefile
1 FILES = $(patsubst %.md, %.docx, $(wildcard *.md))
2 FILES += $(patsubst %.md, %.pdf, $(wildcard *.md))&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#disadvantages-of-git&#34;&gt;Disadvantages of Git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;version-control-systems&#34;&gt;Version control systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A version control system is software that facilitates work with changing information. A version control system allows you to store several versions of the same document, if necessary, return to earlier versions, determine who made a particular change and when. Such systems are widely used in software development for storing source codes. However, they can also be used in other areas where work is carried out with a large number of continuously changing electronic documents
A VCS allows you to return the entire project to its previous state, compare changes from a certain time, see who last changed the module that failed, who created the problem, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;git-advantages-and-disadvantages&#34;&gt;Git. Advantages and Disadvantages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is one of the most popular version control systems in the world of software development. It was developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and is distinguished by its speed, flexibility, and distributed architecture. [1]
The main features of Git include the ability to create local repositories on the developer&amp;rsquo;s computer, quick branching and merging of changes, effective project management of any size, and good support for working with branching and merging. In addition, Git has extensive capabilities for customizing the workflow and integrating with various hosting services, such as GitHub and Bitbucket. (fig. @fig:002).
The main difference between Git and any other version control system is the way Git views its data. Basically, most other systems store information as a list of changes for files. These systems treat the stored data as a set of files and changes made to each of these files over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advantages-of-git&#34;&gt;Advantages of Git&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A reliable system for comparing revisions and checking the correctness of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A flexible system for branching projects and merging branches with each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The presence of a local repository containing complete information about all changes allows you to maintain full local version control and upload only fully verified changes to the main repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High performance and speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A convenient and intuitive set of commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple graphical shells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to create checkpoints where data is saved not using delta compression, but completely. Due to this, the speed of data recovery is reduced, since the closest checkpoint is taken as a basis, therefore, recovery is carried out from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Widespread use, easy accessibility and high-quality documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The flexibility of the system allows you to conveniently configure it and even create specialized user interfaces based on Git.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Universal network access using http, ftp, rsync, ssh and other protocols&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disadvantages-of-git&#34;&gt;Disadvantages of Git&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unix-oriented. At the moment, there is no official full-fledged implementation of Git compatible with other operating systems, such as Windows, Mac OS and the like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possible (but extremely low) matches of the hash code of revisions with different content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only changes to the entire project are tracked, not individual files, which can be inconvenient when working with large projects containing many unrelated files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When initially (first) creating a repository and synchronizing it with other developers, it will take quite a long time to download the data, especially if the project is large, since it will be necessary to copy the entire repository to the local computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git, due to its speed, flexibility and distributed architecture, is well suited for developing various projects and has extensive customization and integration capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

## Routine

I did a lot of useful things over the weekend. I did a general cleaning in the room, read books, did laboratory work. I try to adjust my sleep schedule and eat right. I start every morning with exercises, stretching, and music. It helps a lot to wake up, warm up the body, raises the mood and the desire to start a new day. The event of the week happened today: Dad came to Moscow, we saw each other for a few hours, I'm very glad)

## Homework

There wasn't much homework during the week, but it accumulated closer to the weekend. I am currently doing a project and laboratory work on operating systems. Of the rest, I need to make a history report by Saturday, write code on programming technology. I'm not happy with my homework, I want to go for a walk:( 

## Weather

The weather turned out to be strange and changeable this week. The snow and -6, the sun and +7, as, for example, today. I would rather have a full-fledged spring, bask in the sun and enjoy life.

## Music 

This week I'm listening to super calm, light spring songs, mostly French for some reason. Also, Elvis Presley and other talented performers of that era have often been heard in my playlist in recent days. I can't help but mention the opera: the roles of Luciano Pavarotti from such opera classics as Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto, Georges Bizet's Carmen, and Aram Khachaturian's Masquerade. This is very talented and takes you by the heart, brings you some kind of peace.


## Assessment of the week  

 I'll give 9/10. For it to be 10/10, everything must be perfect, and who doesn't have a single breakdown in a whole week!

## Routine

The weekend is very busy. Last week, a friend from another city came to see me, we hadn't seen each other for 5 months and we missed each other very much. We went for a walk, I introduced her to my friends, it was fun. When she left, everything went back to normal: studying, household chores. It was Sasha's birthday, we were congratulating him at night and I dropped the cake. But everything went well in the end. This weekend I even managed to arrange a sleepover with my best friend, whom I rarely see because of our studies. But every our meeting is a kind of celebration!

## Study

There were two tests on the same day during the week, which put me under a lot of stress. I'm waiting for the results, the preparation should have paid off. After them, I feel less busy, I rest more and go about my business, I even got to the festival of Swahili culture in the main building of the Rudn University. English classes are so diverse.. In general, I'm glad that during the classes, and between them, and even in time free from them, there are friends with whom it's more fun to live.

## Weather

I just don't have the words for the weather. There was a good plus temperature during the week, and on Friday it was summer in general! The sun, the heat was +15, it was such a good mood! And what do I see the next day?! The heat abruptly left, the wind, the rain, it actually snowed on Sunday and it will be like this all week!! Of course, I understand that it's a sin for me, a northern person, to complain about the winter in April, but that's not why I moved. In general, there is no positive feedback about the weather, let it be corrected.

## Music 

I plunged into some memories of bygone years, turning on my playlist from the end. And there it was: Russian rap, and the legendary foreign hip-hop of the noughties, and the 80s with Bowie and Queen, and the eternally cheerful Spain, which sounded in every house where the radio worked on sunny weekends. It's just nostalgia, which seems to be returning to fashion in the world of my preferences.


## Assessment of the week 

I'll give 9/10 again. The tests and the weather are to blame!!

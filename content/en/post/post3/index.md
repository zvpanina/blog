## Routine

It's been an eventful week. A lot of new people came into my life, and on Monday night we congratulated Timofey on his birthday and wished him a Student of the Year award. And so it turned out: he won the audience award, which we happily celebrated. I also want to mention my favorite mint smoothie, which I take from a well-known institution. It was very tasty, I drank two servings that evening and went to rest. The weekend was fun and flew by with a bang. Believe me, it was fun. In general, we walked a lot during the week, we are also actively preparing for the second stage of the school of curators, there were a lot of meetings and filming, much more needs to be done in the next two days.

## Study

Studying this week didn't feel so obvious due to the abundance of other things to do. But I don't even want to talk about yesterday: the programming technology class just shocked me! It is necessary to do five hundred laboratory works at the same time, while turning over a lot of theory for each one, write reports and defend them. And all this falls just at the time when I will be doing vital things and I will not be up to it!! Why are they all together at the same time???!! Still, the only thing that doesn't bring nerves is the Spanish class.

## Weather

The kaleidoscope again. It was just unbearable heat for a week, summer, +25, then sharply +5 and the wind - I had to get my jacket and coat back, and today, on the spring and labor day, it was raining all day. But I love it when you're sitting at home, studying, watching movies or reading books, generally doing anything - you look out the window, and everything is green and it's raining, such a pleasant fresh smell and soothing sound of rain. One hundred out of a hundred.

## Music 

In addition to my favorite band INXS, I can say that it was a women's week in terms of music: Adele, Sia, Sinead O'Connor, Amy Winehouse and others, as well as a large number of Bruno Mars.

## Assessment of the week 

8/10. Probably due to the weather changes, the sluggish state, as well as everyone left for their cities((

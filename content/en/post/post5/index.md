## Routine

It's been a crazy week. I've never had enough sleep for it yet. On Saturday morning, Camilla and I attended the opening of a new coffee shop, and we were given gifts as the first visitors. I agree, it's worth waking up early. I spent the whole Sunday writing a programming lab, and I'm not at all satisfied with the weekend I spent, but at least I did something important. On Wednesday night, I went to wish Camilla a happy birthday, gave her a peony and a cake, and in the afternoon, after several hours of preparing for the mathlogics test with my classmates, we celebrated her birthday at the slot machine club!! We were happy, walking around the center of Moscow and drinking festive drinks. The next day, yesterday, after four hours of sleep, I wrote the test in the morning and spent the rest of the day doing homework and cooking. Honestly, I'm tired, but aint any rest expected today or tomorrow (

## Study

The last weeks of studying are underway, and we are working hard. Starting on Sunday, everything was about study: I literally fell asleep next to my laptop at the table or on the bed and woke up in the morning to prepare for the defense of my works. I passed them safely on Wednesday, it remains to close several subjects, wait for the results of the tests and final scores for the semester - then only the exams. 

## Weather

The heat!! +26 all week, we pour water over ourselves, we turn on the fans manually. There's a cool breeze in the evening and it's really fresh, and every street smells like lilacs. Adore.

## Music 

I went crazy and listened to immortal Russian classics. Meladze, BAND'EROS, Vintage, Nyusha, SEREBRO, 5sta Family, t.A.T.u., Bianca, Leps and many others. It was strong. A complete immersion in a very recently passed era. From abroad - Nelly Furtado, Lesley Gore, Blondie, Fleetwood Mac, Bob Marley and others. This is a very strange and diverse set this time..

## Assessment of the week 

9/10. Even though this week is full of work, the birthday was great, the coffee from the best barista of the best coffee shop was great, the whole week was fun.

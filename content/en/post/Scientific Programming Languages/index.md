There are hundreds of programming languages ​​in the world today - how to choose the best one to learn? We publish a list of the most popular options.
1. **Bash**. Unix shell scripting, created by Ken Thompson in the early 1970s, is closely related to the C programming language. Bash, an updated Unix shell, was first released in the late 80s and is still actively developed. Bash is commonly used for writing server configuration scripts, making it a good choice for working in modern cloud environments with container storage and microservices. Shell scripting is used quite often, so knowing this language will come in handy.
2. **C/C++**.
These languages ​​often occupy the top of various rankings - they are valued for their power and speed. C was created in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, C++ was developed in 1985 by Bjarne Stroustrup. Today, these two languages ​​underlie everything from operating systems and games to modern scientific computing and machine learning. C and C++ are well suited for demanding applications that require low-level access to hardware and performance. Learning these languages ​​takes time and some effort. 
3. **C#**, released by Microsoft in 2000, was developed by Anders Hejlsberg as a cross-platform object-oriented programming language. Nowadays, it is often used to develop business applications, APIs, games, and more. Its wide range of features makes it suitable for graphics and other asynchronous programming tasks.
4. **Java** is a general-purpose object-oriented programming language developed in the 1990s by James Gosling at Sun (now owned by Oracle) and designed to be compiled into bytecode to run on the Java Virtual Machine. By 2020, these include almost every kind of device, from TVs and game consoles to servers, phones, and even kitchen appliances. The language is widely used in corporations and universities, making it popular with both novice programmers and experienced developers.
5. **JavaScript** was developed by Brandon Eich in the 1990s to add script execution to websites. Today, it is a universal web interface language with powerful, standardized features that are supported by all major browsers. JavaScript follows the EcmaScript standard, which is updated every few years with new language specifications. JavaScript is also commonly used to develop server-side services and APIs, mobile apps, games, and other software. It is a great choice for learning and improving. 
6. **Python**. Introduced in 1991 by Guido van Rossum, Python was conceived as a readable language with OOP features that uses functional paradigms to build clean and well-organized programs. Python has support on major platforms and is used in a variety of fields, including science, data mining, artificial intelligence, computer graphics for feature films, cloud computing, game development, and many others. Python has proven itself and will remain one of the most in-demand tools for a long time.
7. **SQL** is a general-purpose programming language, but is a powerful domain-specific language for managing relational databases. Its use cases range from Fortune 500 data warehouses to embedded SQLite, and it is widely used in desktop and mobile applications. Many IT and development positions require at least basic knowledge of SQL. Advanced skills allow a developer to create extremely secure and reliable domain rules independent of the programming language or SDK used. High-profile implementations include Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, and PostgreSQL. Each of them has a unique extension of the SQL language and offers new features that go beyond the basic SQL specification. Learning SQL does not take much time and is useful in many areas from analytics and data processing to IT management and software development.

Thus, each of the listed languages ​​is specialized to solve a certain type of problem. The choice of the appropriate language depends on the goals and objectives of the programmer.

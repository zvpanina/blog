## Routine

It's been a quiet but eventful week. We celebrated my friend Vicki's birthday, met interesting people, had a lot of things: a pajama party, a murder investigation game, a PowerPoint party, lots of delicious food and everything. At the same time, I met a friend who came from another city for her birthday and managed to give her a mini-tour of the campus. My mom also came to visit me for the weekend, and we had a great time together. We played billiards, walked, and had a delicious meal. After a long break for the holidays, I finally met my beloved classmates, we already missed each other very much. I met my brother, and this weekend I'm going to his soccer tournament, and I'm going to cheer!

## Study

Last time, I expressed my anger about the programming technology class. I would like to inform you that by today's class I had completed all four laboratory work, and last Wednesday I defended the second one. There are two remaining defenses (read Pavlovskaya!!) And that's basically it. In general, as the semester approaches the end, many subjects are already closing and the exams and the session are approaching(( But never mind, we will cope!! Now we need to focus on matlogics and matanalysis, the tests are coming up, and over the holidays we forgot everything and now we need to catch up and do our homework. In addition, I am urgently completing tests on subjects, completing an individual project, laboratory work and an external course on operating systems. In general, things are going through the roof, as always!!!

## Weather

On the one hand, it's nice that it wasn't +30 heat and it's possible to be outside, but on the other hand, I wish it was a little warmer by at least a few degrees. It was mostly this week +8 - +10 And it's raining all the time. But I like rain, but I don't like cold:( I don't want to wear a jacket in May anymore, let's have good weather!!

## Music 

It's all one to one: rainy weather - and most of all I want to listen to the band alt-J. I just overlistened to them, their music is literally saturated with freshness, rain, and tranquility. I also listened to Champs, Labrinth, Fleetwood Mac, Jacob Bellens.

## Assessment of the week 

9/10. The weather spoils everything a bit, but everything else was fine.
